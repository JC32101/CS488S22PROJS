The HTTP package wireshark captured is persistent HTTP, because the connection of HTTP/1.1 is stated as keep-alive meaning that it uses persistent connection.
HTTP/1.1 are also persistent by default unless the connection is stated as closed.
If the connection is closed, then the HTTP will be non-persistent.
